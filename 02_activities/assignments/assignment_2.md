# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      Good Visulization - https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jonathan.akpogbo.chris/viz/MeanTempearaturesofPlanets/Dashboard1
      I believe this is a good data visulization as its easy to understand what is being portrayed quickly. The temprature scale used is consistent (for both celsius and fahrenheit). When you hover over the image of the planets it provides the name of the planet and the mean temprature. By using a box and whisker plot the author shows the distribution and outliers in a quick and efficient manner. 


      Bad Visulization - https://flowingdata.com/2013/10/14/pizza-place-geography/
      I believe this is a bad data visulization as its difficult to read. Some of the colours selected to represent chains look alike and blend in on the map. Its difficult to see the state boundaries as well. The visulization also doesn't mention how many restaurants are represented by a single dot on the map. 





      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      This visulization can be improved by selecting different colours the represent the restaurants, identifying how many restaurants are represented by each dot and clearly defining state boundaries. It would also be beneficial to also focus on the chains that are available all over the US and not just in select States to get a cleaner looking and more complete map. 





      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)

### Why am I doing this assignment?:

- This assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story
