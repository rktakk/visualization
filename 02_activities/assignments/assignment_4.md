# Data Visualization

## Assignment 4: Final Project

### Requirements:
- We will finish this class by giving you the chance to use what you have learned in a practical context, by creating data visualizations from raw data. 
- Choose a dataset of interest from the [City of Torontoâ€™s Open Data Portal](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/) or [Ontarioâ€™s Open Data Catalogue](https://data.ontario.ca/). 
- Using Python and one other data visualization software (Excel or free alternative, Tableau Public, any other tool you prefer), create two distinct visualizations from your dataset of choice.  
- For each visualization, describe and justify: 
    > What software did you use to create your data visualization?

        *For the bar graph and the horizontal bar graph I created these visulizations in VS Code using the code that we learned in class. 
        *For the graph with three line graphs I used Tableau Public. 

    > Who is your intended audience? 

        *The intended audience for these visulizations are invividuals concerned about bee health in Ontario and those interested in honey produced in Ontario. 

    > What information or message are you trying to convey with your visualization? 

        *There is a decline in honey production in Ontario. It would be beneficial to pull in additional data sets such as those about the health of bee's in Ontario, weather data and construction on farming land to show what is leading to the decline. 

    > What design principles (substantive, perceptual, aesthetic) did you consider when making your visualization? How did you apply these principles? With what elements of your plots? 

        *I wanted to make my graphs easy to understand and be accessible for all. I tried to keep them as simple as possible and to the point. 
    
    > How did you ensure that your data visualizations are reproducible? If the tool you used to make your data visualization is not reproducible, how will this impact your data visualization? 

        *I uploaded the raw data file that I downloaded for this dataset along with the CSV version of the file. 
        *I have also provided the code used and added in comments to indicate what each block of code does. 
    
    > How did you ensure that your data visualization is accessible?  

        *I selected colours that are easy to see and added gridlines to the two bargraphs to divide up the data making it easier to read. 
        *I selected an easy to read font and made it a bit larger than normal so it easy to read. 
        *For the Tableau graph I selected 3 distinct colours so if the graph is viewed in greyscale individuals would still be able to differentate between the colours. 
    
    > Who are the individuals and communities who might be impacted by your visualization?  

        *Beekeepers, farmers who rely on bees to pollinate their crops and anyone who purchases honey and vegetables produced in Ontario. 
    
    > How did you choose which features of your chosen dataset to include or exclude from your visualization? 

        *I wanted to show case the downward trend so I analyzed the dataset and selected aspects that would best indicate this. 
    
    > What â€˜underwater labourâ€™ contributed to your final data visualization product?
        *I cleaned the dataset and created a CSV version of it. I also played around with the colours and fonts for each graphs until I was satisfied with the end result. 

- This assignment is intentionally open-ended - you are free to create static or dynamic data visualizations, maps, or whatever form of data visualization you think best communicates your information to your audience of choice! 
- Total word count should not exceed **(as a maximum) 1000 words** 
 
### Why am I doing this assignment?:  
- This ongoing assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes: 
* Create and customize data visualizations from start to finish in Python
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story  
- This would be a great project to include in your GitHub Portfolio â€“ put in the effort to make it something worthy of showing prospective employers!
